## Image Placement

Your Jacksonville hero skyline image is now in place:

1. âœ… **Image file**: `jacksonville hero skyline.png` is now in the public directory
2. **Accessible at**: `/jacksonville hero skyline.png`
3. **File size**: 651KB - good quality for web use
4. **Current usage**: The hero section in `app/page.tsx` is now using this image

## Current Usage

The hero section in `app/page.tsx` is now configured to use this image with:
- **Subtle dark overlay**: 25% opacity (`bg-black/25`) for natural blending
- **Enhanced text visibility**: Added drop shadows to all text elements
- **Professional appearance**: Text now has `drop-shadow-2xl` for headlines and `drop-shadow-lg` for content

## Why You Don't See the Image

The image is not displaying because the `jacksonville-hero-skyline.jpg` file hasn't been added to this directory yet. Once you add the image file here, it will appear immediately.
